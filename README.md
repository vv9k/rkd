## CONFIG
the config file has a syntax very similar to `sxhkd`:
```
super + 1
	bspc desktop -f ^1
super + 2
	bspc desktop -f ^2
super + 3
	bspc desktop -f ^3
super + q
	bspc node -c
# You can do either this
super + Q
	bspc node -k
# or this
super + shift + q
	bspc node -k

```
The first key has to be one of `super`|`shift`|`alt`|`ctrl`. The modifier key can be followed by any amount of other mod keys but to actually execute the keybinding on of `[0-9a-z,./;'\\[\]]` has to be pressed.
